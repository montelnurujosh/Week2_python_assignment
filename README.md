# üêç Python List Operations Practice

This simple Python script demonstrates how to perform basic operations on a list in Python.

## üîß What it does

- Creates an empty list called `my_list`
- Appends the elements: `10`, `20`, `30`, `40`
- Inserts the value `15` at the second position (index 1)
- Extends the list with another list: `[50, 60, 70]`
- Removes the last element from the list
- Sorts the list in ascending order
- Finds and prints the index of the value `30`

---

## üß† Purpose

This script is meant for practice and learning how to:
- Use core Python list methods like `append()`, `insert()`, `extend()`, `pop()`, `sort()`, and `index()`
- Understand list manipulation and data organization

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Sample Output

```python
Index of 30: 4
